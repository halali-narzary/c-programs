Q) Explain the primary differences between an array and a linked list in terms of memory allocation, insertion/deletion efficiency, and data access.
ANS:-
Memory Allocation:
                Arrays use contiguous memory and must be defined with a fixed size at creation, which can lead to wasted space if not all elements are used.
                Linked lists store each node separately in scattered memory and can grow or shrink as needed, thus using memory more efficiently.

Insertion/Deletion Efficiency: 
                In arrays, insertion and deletion operations can require shifting elements, making these operations slow (O(n)). 
                In linked lists, insertion and deletion are efficient (O(1)) because they involve only pointer adjustments, not shifting entire blocks of data.

Data Access: 
                Arrays allow direct, random access to any element using indices (O(1) time). Linked lists allow only sequential (linear) access; to reach the nth node, 
                all previous nodes must be traversed (O(n) time).
